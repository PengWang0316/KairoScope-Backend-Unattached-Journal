## Functions are hosting on AWS lambda function

### Some explainations

- The wrapper middleware wrappers sample-logging and function-shield for all of the function who uses wrapper.js to wrapper its handler.
- The flush-metrics middleware will be in charge of flush the metrics as batch for a function. (If the function definds async_metrics: true in the serverless.yml, this middleware does not have to apply due to the metrics will be sent asynchronously)
- log.js in the libs folder can be used to perform logs with different levels (debug, info, warn, error).
- cloudwatch.js in the libs folder has several methods to collect metrics for a function.
